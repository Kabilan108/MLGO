\section*{Abstract}

The paper presents a neural network model for predicting enriched Gene Ontology (GO)
terms from RNA-Seq differential expression analysis (DEA) data. We trained an
autoencoder model using log fold change (logFC) values from mouse RNA-Seq datasets
curated from the Digital Expression Explorer 2 repository. We hypothesized that the
autoencoder's latent space would capture the essential features and patterns of the
logFC values to predict enriched GO terms. We normalized the feature matrix,
removed low-variance genes, and compared their approach to previous studies. The results
demonstrated that the autoencoder was able to reconstruct the log fold change values
with a mean squared error of 0.92.
