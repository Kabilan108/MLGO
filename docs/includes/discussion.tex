\section{Discussion}

Summarize/discuss your results, without repeating verbatim what you already have in the
Abstract or Results.\\
Do your results make sense biologically? Find studies that support your findings. (E.g.,
you found 10 genes in your Alzheimer's dataset analysis, check literature to see if
these genes are known for their involvement in Alzheimer's).\\
What are the limitations of your study?\\
What follow up studies can be performed to im-prove upon your findings?
