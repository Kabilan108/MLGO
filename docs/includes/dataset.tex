\section{Dataset}

We used the \emph{Digital Expression Explorer 2} (DEE2) project as the primary source of
RNA-seq data for our analysis. The DEE2 project is a curated repository of uniformly
processed RNA-seq data collected from public repositories, including the Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
\cite{DEE2}.The raw fastq files are downloaded from the SRA, undergo quality control and
alignment to the reference genome, and are quantified using the STAR and Kallisto tools.
The feature count and metadata tables are available for download from the DEE2 website,
and through the `getDEE2' R package. A metadata table which lists all curated datasets
for each species is also available for download. DEE2 provides 532,711 processed RNA-seq
runs (SRRs) from mouse experiments and 475,547 processed RNA-seq runs from human
experiments, as well as other species \cite{DEE2}.

For our analysis, we curated a subset of the mouse RNA-seq data, which consisted of
11,130 unique datasets with over 350,000 individual runs. We obtained additional
metadata for these datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We
filtered out datasets that had only one sample, or that did not have at least two
distict conditions or labels. This resulted in a final collection of 7,130 datasets
with gene counts for 48,978 genes.
